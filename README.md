# XP_and_Initiative_Tracker
A tracker for XP and Initiative made for the Pathfinder TTRPG game. It can be easily adapted for D&D or other XP-based TTRPGs. The XP calculation can be easily modified by editing the file calculoxp.dart in the utils folder.
The current version of this repository is in Spanish because I programmed the app for myself in Spanish (because I speak Spanish). I might change this so that it becomes more accessible for others, but please note that this implies changing all of the variable names, and the app may break, so it might take a while.
