If the humanoid form assumed lacks the aquatic trait, the veiled master loses its own aquatic trait as well. In humanoid form, the veiled master can use weapons, or it can make Strikes that work like its tentacle attack but use the reach of its current form. If the assumed form has fangs or claws, the veiled master can also make such Strikes, but these attacks lack the veiled master's slime.; Consume Memories - (mental, occult) When a veiled master makes a fangs Strike against a creature, it can consume some of that creature's memories. The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude saving throw or become stupefied 1. A veiled master regains 5 Hit Points each time it successfully consumes memories. When a veiled master consumes memories, it learns some of the creature's memories (subject to the GM's discretion).; Delayed Suggestion - (enchantment, occult) When a veiled master successfully casts dominate on a creature, a suggestion spell triggers when the dominate spell ends. This suggestion usually causes the target to return to the veiled master, so the creature can cast dominate again, but a veiled master can set the suggestion to different orders if it wishes.; Slime - (curse, occult, virulent) Saving Throw Fortitude DC 36; Stage 1 no ill effect (1 round); Stage 2 the victim's skin softens, inflicting drained 1 (1 round); Stage 3 the victim's skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane, inflicting drained 2 until the curse ends; every hour this membrane remains dry, the creature's drained condition increases by 1 (permanent).

Make a tentacle Strike against each creature within its reach. Roll only one attack roll, and roll the damage only once for all targets.; Thoughtlance - (curse, enchantment, occult) A creature touched by the veiled master's tentacles, whether those tentacles deal damage or not, must attempt a DC 34 Will save, becoming slowed 1 on a failure or slowed 2 on a critical failure. Each time the affected creature ends its turn, its slowed value decreases by 1.; Mucus Cloud - (aura, disease) 30 feet. While underwater, a veiled master exudes a cloud of transparent slime.

    "movs": "+1 status to all saves vs. magic; Ranged - [1 Action] - Sphere of Oblivion +37 [+32/+27] (magical), Effect: see Sphere of Oblivion; Energy Touch - A pleroma's touch deals its choice of positive or negative damage, but neither energy can be used to heal a creature.; Sphere of Creation - [2 Actions] - (incapacitation, magical) Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of white energy that hovers above its left hand. By using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, the pleroma can cause the sphere to fly 10 feet. The sphere can move in any direction, ignoring difficult terrain, but it can't move farther than 300 feet away from the pleroma. Wherever the sphere travels, it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain (the pleroma's choice of normal, difficult, or greater difficult terrain) or a 5-foot-square solid barrier of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood, or stone). The sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM's choice away from the sphere. Those who fail take 20d6 positive damage (even if they are living) and are pushed away as a success. Those who critically fail, or are reduced to 0 HP by the damage from a failure, become one with the new material and can be restored only via a 10th-level spell. A pleroma can have only one Sphere of Creation in existence at a time, and the sphere automatically vanishes in a flash of blinding light after 1d4 minutes. All creatures within 30 feet of the sphere of creation when it vanishes must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded.; Sphere of Oblivion - [2 Actions] - (incapacitation, magical) Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of complete and utter darkness that hovers above its right hand. It can move and control the sphere in the same manner as its Sphere of Creation. The sphere is an empty void that lasts for 1 minute before collapsing in on itself and winking out of existence. Once manifested, the sphere can be used as a ranged attack, but it blinks out of existence immediately after that attack is resolved. Any unattended object that touches the void is sucked in and completely destroyed. Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube per round of contact. The sphere can enter the space of a creature, with effects similar to the Sphere of Creation except that it deals negative damage (even to undead) on a failure and annihilates rather than incorporating the creature into material. Such a destroyed creature can be restored only by a 10th-level spell.; Envisioning - Pleromas care little for communication with other creatures, but when they do convey information, they do so wordlessly through a series of psychic projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have a language, though the aeon's meaning to non-aeons can be vague and is often mysterious. An aeon can use this ability to communicate flawlessly with any other aeon on the same plane as itself.; Reality Twist - [Reaction] - Trigger: The pleroma critically fails the saving throw. Effect: The critical failure becomes a normal failure.; Divine Innate Spells - DC 47, attack +37; 10th alter reality; 9th banishment, blade barrier, disjunction, overwhelming presence; 8th disintegrate (x2), unrelenting observation; 7th plane shift, retrocognition; 5th creation (at will); 4th create food (at will), shape stone (at will); 3rd hypercognition (at will); 2nd detect alignment (at will), shape wood (at will); 1st create water (at will); Constant (8th) true seeing; (4th) freedom of movement",

It can't use Eye Beams again for 1d4 rounds.; Repository of Lore - While the cassisian isn't particularly intelligent, it has perfect memory and can remember everything it sees or hears. This allows it to attempt Lore checks on any topic, provided (at the GM's discretion) the cassisian has encountered the topic in question before. The cassisian's limited intellect often prevents it from acting upon its knowledge, making it a better resource than agent in matters of information use.; Transfer Protection - A non-evil creature can wear a willing cassisian as a helmet.

A humanoid can't have more than one profane gift at a time, and a succubus can't grant more than one profane gift at a time. Removing the gift requires an atone ritual.

Even on a failed attack, the hydra deals the damage from one fangs Strike to the target creature, though it still misses completely on a critical failure. This counts toward the hydra's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of heads the hydra has.; Storm of Jaws - [2 Actions] - The hydra makes a number of Strikes up to its number of heads, each against a different target. These attacks count toward the hydra's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the hydra makes all its attacks.; Attack of Opportunity - [Reaction] -; Head Regrowth - A hydra ordinarily has five heads. A creature can attempt to sever one of the hydra's heads by specifically targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head's Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end of any creature's turn.; A hydra can regrow a severed head using Hydra Regeneration. A creature can prevent this regrowth by dealing acid or fire damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target acid or fire effects need to be targeted at a specific stump, but effects that deal splash damage or affect areas covering the hydra's whole space cauterize all stumps if they deal acid or fire damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any acid or fire damage, the stump is cauterized instantly. If all five heads are cauterized, the hydra dies.; Hydra Regeneration - The hydra has regeneration equal to 3 x the number of heads it has. If a hydra's body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized, the hydra attempts a DC 25 Fortitude save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration. On a success, one uncauterized stump regrows two heads; on a critical success, two uncauterized stumps regrow into two heads each. The hydra can never grow more than double the number of heads it ordinarily has. The hydra's regeneration only fully deactivates if all its heads are severed and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it dies.; Multiple Opportunities - A hydra gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads beyond the first, which it can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity. It can't use more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within its reach, and the hydra must use a different head for each Attack of Opportunity it makes.

Each eye contains an 8th-level spell that targets one creature (usually one eye has maze and the other polar ray). The demilich can Activate an eye. This uses the number of spellcasting actions the spell requires, and also requires command and envision components. When the demilich casts a spell from a gemstone eye, that eye stops glowing for 1d4 rounds, during which time that eye's spell can't be used. Occasionally, one or both of the two demilich eye gems can be harvested from a destroyed demilich as magic items.; Devour Soul - [1 Action] - (arcane, necromancy, negative) Requirements: A soul has been trapped in one of the demilich's blight quartz gems (see Trap Soul) for 24 hours. Effect: The demilich consumes the soul. The soul is utterly destroyed, and the demilich regains HP equal to double the creature's level.; Mental Magic - A demilich can replace all material and somatic components for casting spells with verbal components, and can replace all Interact components for activating magic items with envision components.; Staff Gems - A demilich long ago absorbed the spells from a staff into gemstone nodules embedded in its skull, with larger nodules representing higher-level spells. It can cast any of the spells as though it were Activating the staff, and regains 1 charge per 4 hours spent in torpor, to a maximum of 8 charges. A typical demilich has the spells from a greater staff of necromancy, but it could have spells from another staff of 8th level or lower instead.; Trap Soul - [1 Action] - command Frequency once per day per gem; Effect: Ten blight quartz gemstones on the demilich's skull can trap the souls of the living. The Activated gem casts bind soul. This bind soul can target and affect a dying creature instead of a corpse. The dying creature can attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save; if it succeeds, it doesn't die and its soul is not trapped but it's enervated 2 (or is unaffected entirely on a critical success). When the soul of a creature gets trapped, the creature's body swiftly turns to dust. The gemstones work like the black sapphires used in bind soul, except that they can hold creatures of up to 17th level and have a value of 200 gp apiece. The demilich can Devour a Soul it has trapped.; Torpor - Typically, a demilich is inert when encountered and doesn't take actions until its contingency reaction has been triggered (see below).; Telekinetic Whirlwind - (arcane, aura, evocation) 20 feet. Telekinetic whirlwind activates when the demilich ends torpor. Loose debris in the area whip up into a whirling storm. This obscures vision, making any creature in the area concealed, and causes creatures in its area (except the demilich) to treat all creatures as concealed. Any creature other than the demilich that enters or begins its turn in the aura takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage.; Contingency - [Reaction] - A demilich has one permanent 8th-level contingency spell in effect with one of its arcane innate spells of 5th level or lower as the companion spell— typically dimension door. Trigger: While the lich is in torpor, a creature disturbs the demilich's remains, touches its treasure, or casts a spell that would affect the demilich. Effect: The demilich ends torpor, rolls initiative, and gains the effect of its contingency's companion spell. The contingency resets after 24 hours.; Countermeasures - [Free Action] - Trigger: The demilich's turn begins. Effect: The demilich casts blink, fly, spell turning, or true seeing on itself. It usually chooses spell turning unless it already has that spell in effect.; Arcane Innate Spells - DC 40, attack +30; 9th wail of the banshee; 7th spell turning (at will); 4th blink (at will), dimension door (at will), telekinetic maneuver (at will); Cantrips (8th) mage hand, telekinetic projectile; Constant (6th) true seeing",

If a creature is slain by this attack, its soul becomes trapped within the devourer. While trapped, a creature cannot be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a wish spell. Destroying the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul (see spell deflection) releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one soul at a time. A soul has 5 soul charges per level. The devourer can expend charges to cast spells (see the soul spells ability below). If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature is drained 1 for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by powerful magic such as wish.; Drain Life - (divine, necromancy) When the devourer damages a living creature with its claw Strike, the devourer gains 10 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become drained 1. Further damage dealt by the devourer increases the amount of drain by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.; Soul Spells - A devourer casts occult innate spells, but to do so must expend a number of soul charges equal to the spell's level (similar to casting a spell using charges from a staff). It can heighten any spell to a maximum of 6th level by expending more charges as it Casts the Spell. When encountered, a devourer typically has one trapped soul with 10 soul charges.; Spell Deflection - (abjuration, divine) A spellcaster can target a devourer with a mental spell, banishment, bind soul, divine decree, divine wrath, possession, spirit blast, or spirit song to attempt to counteract the devourer's Devour Soul effect.

Once a herecite has used this ability (whether or not it was successful), the cabal must wait 24 hours before one of its members can use Assault the Soul again.; Cabal Communion - [2 Actions] - (auditory, concentrate) With murmurs and chants, the herecite casts its consciousness toward the other members of its cabal. For 1 round, it senses what other members are sensing, knows their thoughts, and knows their exact location.; Curse of Defiled Idols - [2 Actions] - (curse, divine, evil) Recalling the cruelty of the foul ritual that birthed it, the herecite curses an enemy with a fragment of its blasphemy. The herecite targets one creature within 30 feet, which must attempt a DC 29 Will save. On a failure, the creature is cursed. As long as the creature is cursed, any art object, symbol, or implement of religious significance in the creature's possession—such as a divine spellcasting focus, holy text, fetish, or rendering of a deity—becomes physically corrupted in a way that debases the deity's tenets (a depiction of Shelyn's songbird, for example, might lose its beautiful plumage to reveal a hideous skeletal form beneath). While these items continue to function normally, the cursed creature is stupefied 2 as long as it possesses an object corrupted in this fashion. The creature can cast off its corrupted objects to remove the stupefied condition, but any new religious objects it takes into its possession become similarly corrupted. The curse can be lifted by a remove curse spell or by an atone ritual. After a creature is targeted with this ability, regardless of whether it was affected, it becomes immune to herecites' Curse of Defiled Idols for 1 day.; Cabal - Multiple herecites can form a cabal to gain increased magical abilities and defenses. A cabal consists of two to five herecites. The ritual to form a cabal (or to welcome new herecites into an existing cabal) requires 24 hours of worship, prayer, and vile sacrifice, after which point the herecites become magically bound to one another. All herecites in a cabal gain the cleric domain spells granted by each individual herecite's deity, and each herecite's focus pool increases to 3 Focus Points. As long as the cabal exists, herecites in the cabal gain a +2 status bonus to Perception checks and fast healing 10. These benefits persist as long as the cabal consists of two or more herecites that remain within 1 mile of one another.; Herecite Deity - A herecite is associated with one evil god and is always of the same alignment as that god. Whenever it wields its deity's favored weapon, that weapon gains the unholy rune. The herecite's creators select two domains from their deity; the herecite can cast the domain spells and the advanced domain spells from those domains as cleric focus spells. The herecite can cast the deity's other granted cleric spells as divine innate spells. Most herecites have 2 Focus Points in their focus pool. The herecite presented here is a herecite of Zevgavizeb.; Perverse Prayer - [Reaction] - (auditory, divine, evil) Trigger: A creature within 30 feet uses the Sustain a Spell action to sustain a divine spell or the Cast a Spell action to cast a divine spell with a verbal component; Effect: The herecite warps the caster's prayers into a sacrilegious echo praising the evils of its own deity.

When encountered, a devourer typically has one trapped soul with 10 soul charges.; Spell Deflection - (abjuration, divine) A spellcaster who targets a devourer with a mental spell, banishment, bind soul, divine decree, divine wrath, possession, spirit blast, or spirit song can attempt a counteract check to free a soul the devourer has trapped with Devour Soul. If this counteract attempt succeeds, the trapped soul is released (though the creature remains dead), and the devourer can't use any soul charges from that creature. Devourers are otherwise immune to these spells.; Occult Innate Spells - DC 31, see soul spells below; 6th feeblemind, true seeing; 4th confusion, suggestion; 3rd bind undead, paralyze; 2nd death knell; 1st harm; Rituals - DC 31; 2nd create undead",

The dig-widget can be Shoved off, or it can detach itself with an Interact action.; Sneak Attack - A dig-widget's Strikes deal an additional 1d6 precision damage to flat-footed creatures.; Infiltration Tools - A dig-widget's face consists of a set of infiltrator thieves' tools. They can be salvaged from a destroyed dig-widget with a successful DC 20 Crafting check. On a failed check, the tools are destroyed.; Mechanical Vulnerability - A creature with expert proficiency in Thievery can attempt a check to Disable a Device to damage a dig-widget. The DC is 22, and each success deals 20 damage.",

The urdefhan chooses one of two options, each of which requires a DC 22 Fortitude save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both. Drain Blood The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is drained 1 and the urdefhan regains 5 HP (or, on a critical failure, it's drained 2 and the urdefhan regains 10 HP).Drain Vitality (necromancy) The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes enfeebled 1 for 1 hour on a failed save (or enfeebled 2 for 1 hour on a critical failure).; Necrotic Decay - (divine, necromancy, negative) When an urdefhan dies, its invisible flesh quickly rots away and sublimates into a foul-smelling gas that fills a 5-foot emanation around the body. This gas deals 5d6 negative damage to creatures in this area as their flesh curdles and rots as well (DC 21 basic Fortitude save).; Divine Innate Spells - DC 23, attack +15; 3rd harm, paralyze; 2nd darkness, death knell, false life, harm; 1st feather fall (self only), grim tendrils, harm, ray of enfeeblement; Rituals - DC 23; 1st daemonic pact",

Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a -2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: When it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).; A creature can attempt a DC 31 Thievery check to Disable a Device to wind the clockwork down.

If the effect is counteracted, the green man gains 30 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes.; Embed - The green man's thorns embed themselves into any creature they damage, taking root into the ground. A target damaged by a thorn has its Speeds halved, and it can't Step, Fly, air walk, or otherwise leave the ground until the thorn is removed. Removing a thorn requires 3 Interact actions, which don't have to be consecutive.

On a success, the target takes 5d10 additional damage and is affected by Absorb Magic three times. Even on a failure, the target takes the normal effects of a hit with a vine Strike, but on a critical failure, the vines miss completely.; Green Grab - A green man can use their Improved Grab action against a creature of any size.; Green Rituals - A green man can perform all their rituals without secondary casters, relying on their own primal ties to the vital essence in spirits of nature. A green man's awaken animal and primal call rituals work on plants instead of their usual range of choices. Most green men also know the ritual to create various types of leshys and possibly even magic allowing the creation of arboreals or more powerful plant creatures.; Vine Forest - [2 Actions] - The green man lashes out with all six vines to attack many opponents. They make up to six vine Strikes, each against a different target; this counts as one attack for their multiple attack penalty, increasing only after all the attacks are made.; Green Tongue - A green man can communicate with plants, with the effects of speak with plants, and can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on plants and Request things from plants.; Plantsense - A green man can sense life force via plants. This allows them to observe a living or undead creature's vital essence within 60 feet of the green man, but they can also use this precise sense to observe any living or undead creature within 60 feet of any plant matter within 120 feet of the green man. This allows the green man to see living things through solid plant matter, as well as seeing through other barriers if there are plants on the other side.; Axe Vulnerability - A green man takes 20 additional damage from axes.; Green Caress - (aura, incapacitation, plant, primal, transmutation) 60 feet. Living creatures in the area other than plants slowly transform into non-creature plants. The green man can exclude creatures from this effect, but they must be aware of a creature's presence and location to do so. A non-plant creature in the area must attempt a DC 45 Fortitude save immediately before the start of its turn.; Critical Success - The creature is unaffected, or if it is slowed by green caress, it reduces its slowed value by 2.; Success - The creature is unaffected, or if it is slowed by green caress, it reduces its slowed value by 1.; Failure - The creature becomes slowed 1, or if it was already slowed by green caress, increases the slowed value by 1, as their body transforms more and more into a non-creature plant. If the creature ever becomes slowed to the point they have no actions left for their turn, they become an inanimate plant, a condition that can only be reversed by primal phenomenon or similarly powerful magic.; Critical Failure - As failure, except the creature becomes slowed 2 (or increases the condition value by 2).; Root In Place [Reaction] - - Trigger: A creature within the green man's reach uses a move action or leaves a square during a move action it's using; Effect: The green man lashes out to hold the foe in place.

While empowered, the sun-spire deals an additional 2d8 fire damage with all of its attacks and abilities. The sun-spire remains empowered until the end of its next turn.",

Physical movement and battle strain a dead body, and long stretches of inactivity might turn skin and bone brittle. Many Iroran mummies treat themselves by rubbing their skin with alchemical oils and wrapping their bodies in magically treated cotton or linen. Choosing a suitable resting spot as well as trying to maintain this resting place is equally important. Upon awakening, Iroran mummies often discover they've become a nesting place for birds or bats or acquired a thin layer of moss.",

It can cast that spell once; if the spell is of a higher level than half the loreavor's level (5th level or higher for most loreavors), the loreavor must succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + the level of the spell it is attempting to cast; on a failure, the spell fails, and the loreavor becomes stupefied 1 for 1 minute.

On a failure or against a willing target, the prepared arcane spell is transferred from that creature as if it were cast, and Lorthact immediately prepares that spell in the same level slot. If he already had a spell prepared in that slot, the previously prepared spell is lost. That creature is then immune to Arcane Absorption for 24 hours.; Arcane Spellcaster - As long as Lorthact has one arcane spell prepared in this way, all arcane spells are on his spell list, which allows him to activate items such as scrolls, wands, and staves.

Further mental damage dealt by Lorthact increases the value of the stupefied condition by 1 on a failed save to a maximum of stupefied 4.

This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 1 and stupefied 1, and the strigoi regains 13 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.; Sneak Attack - The strigoi servant deals 1d6 extra precision damage to flat-footed creatures.; Shadow Form - [1 Action] - (concentrate, divine, shadow, transmutation) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail.; Strigoi Weaknesses - All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:Revulsion Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to Sense Motive.Sunlight When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like detect evil, senses like lifesense, and the “corpse” taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.Water Revulsion A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes slowed 2 and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed.; Divine Innate Spell - DC 27; 5th levitate (at will)",

The creature becomes drained 1 and stupefied 1, and the strigoi regains 15 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.; Shadow Form - [1 Action] - (concentrate, divine, shadow, transmutation) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail.; Female strigoi; Strigoi Weaknesses - All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:Revulsion Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to Sense Motive.Sunlight When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like detect evil, senses like lifesense, and the “corpse” taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.Water Revulsion A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes slowed 2 and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed.; Divine Innate Spell - DC 27; 5th levitate (at will)",

    "movs": "Create Spawn - (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Domain of Dusk or Drink Essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.; Domain of Dusk - [2 Actions] - (conjuration, divine, shadow) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. Living creatures in this area take 8d6 negative damage(DC 34 basic Fortitude save). A creature that fails this save is also dazzled for 1 round (or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. The strigoi progenitor can't use Domain of Dusk for 1 minute.; Dominate - [2 Actions] - (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate (DC 34) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.; Drink Essence - [1 Action] - (divine, necromancy) Requirements: A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; Effect: The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 2 and stupefied 2, and the strigoi regains 21 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points.

It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious.; Strigoi Weaknesses - All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:Revulsion Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light.

    "att": "Melee - [1 Action] - claw +32 [+28/+24] (agile, finesse, versatile P), Damage 5d6+14 slashing; Melee - [1 Action] - astral silk +32 [+27/+22] (disarm, finesse, magical, reach 20 feet, sweep), Damage 5d4+14 slashing plus 3d6 mental and Separate Astral Body",
    "movs": "Separate Astral Body - [1 Action] - The Weaver buries a silk thread in the target's psyche and tugs, wrenching the target's astral form out of their body. Unless the target succeeds at a DC 36 Will save, their astral form is pulled out, causing a ghostly image of them to appear in an adjacent space of the Weaver's choosing. An astral body is immune to physical damage but affected normally by mental effects, force effects, and effects that directly target the spirit. The target remains connected to their physical body by a silver cord, which is always visible and possibly foils attempts to Hide. Separation from one's astral body takes a toll on the psyche, imposing a -1 status penalty to Will saves and dealing 1d6 persistent mental damage for as long as the body is separated; this increases to 3d6 if the target is ever more than 30 feet from its astral body. The target can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to move their astral body an amount equal to their Speed. When the target stops taking persistent mental damage from this ability, the astral body snaps back to the physical body, ending the effect. If a target is carrying silver, then the first time this ability is used on them, the ability fails and any silver they're carrying larger than a coin tarnishes—while this doesn't outright destroy items like weapons or thaumaturge implements, it does prevent them from protecting against this ability more than once.; Sever Astral Threads - [2 Actions] - The Weaver uses a claw to cut the silver cord connecting a creature's astral and physical bodies. This deals 16d6 mental damage to any target affected by Separate Astral Body whose physical or astral body is within 10 feet of the Weaver (DC 37 basic Will save). After being targeted by this ability, the astral body slams violently back into the target's physical body, causing the target's vision to swim and blinding them until the start of their next turn unless they critically succeeded at their saving throw.; Stalker in Dreams - [Free Action] - (teleportation) Trigger: The Weaver becomes concealed to all creatures within 60 feet or is not observed by any creatures within 60 feet; Effect: The Weaver's presence on the Material Plane is connected to others' perception of him, and when that perception falters, he can skitter to a new location. The Weaver teleports to an unoccupied space within 60 feet not within line of sight of any creatures within 60 feet. If the Weaver became concealed or unobserved as part of a movement action he was taking, he can resume its movement after teleporting. A creature who Averts its Gaze from the Weaver is not observing him.; String Astral Body - [1 Action] - The Weaver attaches strings to a creature's astral body to move it. He forcefully moves an exposed astral body within reach of his astral silk Strike up to 20 feet, with no saving throw.; Dreams Unraveling - (aura, emotion, fear, mental, visual) When the Weaver has fewer than 155 Hit Points, his form partially unravels, revealing patches of pure horror acute enough to leave physical wounds. This creates a 10-foot emanation that deals 3d6 mental damage and 3d6 slashing damage, with a DC 36 basic Will save. A creature Averting its Gaze is immune to the aura.; Nameless Nightmare - The Weaver has torn off his own name to become a being of fear. He is immune to linguistic effects and any effect that would impose the frightened condition. Without a name, he is difficult for phenomena to affect; the Weaver recovers from the paralyzed, slowed, and stunned conditions at the end of his turn, and his flat check to clear persistent damage is 5. If anyone utters, writes, or otherwise attempts to record his name, that creature automatically takes 10 mental damage and the attempt fails.; Stitch into the Web [Reaction] - - Trigger: The Weaver is moved against his will, or a creature attempts to leave a square within 20 feet of him by any means, including teleportation; Effect: The Weaver's silk stitches a body in place to prevent movement. The creature stops moving and the action is disrupted. The disruption doesn't affect astral bodies.",

If the target has a weakness to cold iron, Taviah gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Unlike a normal Grapple, Taviah doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature escapes (DC 29), causing the cage to crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it; it has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points.; Drain Thoughts - [1 Action] - (divination, mental, occult) Requirements: A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within Taviah's reach; Effect: Taviah seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is stupefied 1 (stupefied 2 if Taviah's Athletics check is a critical success), and Taviah regains 18 Hit Points, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to Taviah but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, Taviah views one of the victim's memories, and can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory she views as a 4th-level modify memory spell. A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week. A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose until Taviah is destroyed, becoming permanently unconscious. While unconscious, its stupefied condition doesn't decrease.; Mental Rebirth - (curse, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and unconscious conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.After 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose. When the characters arrive, Taviah has no comatose creatures to transfer her consciousness to.; Paralyzing Claws - (incapacitation, necromancy, occult) Any living creature hit by Taviah's claw Strike must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or become paralyzed. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.; Rend - [1 Action] - claw; Female vetalarana vampire annis hag; Thoughtsense - (divination, mental, occult) Taviah senses non-mindless creatures within 100 feet as a precise sense.; Magaambya Scar - A physical attack on Taviah that scores a critical hit exacerbates the injury in her wounded leg; in addition to the other effects of the critical hit, Taviah is stunned 1.; Occult Innate Spells - DC 30, attack +22; 6th false life, feeblemind, haste, shadow blast; Constant (5th) tongues",

    "movs": "Change Shape - [1 Action] - (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The vampire transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. A vampire guardian's giant bat form's fangs have a +21 attack bonus and deal 2d6+11 piercing damage. Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.; Create Spawn - (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.; Dominate - [2 Actions] - (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell (DC 26). Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.; Drink Blood - [1 Action] - (divine, necromancy) Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. Effect: The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire guardian regains 13 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.; Sneak Attack - A vampire guardian deals 1d6 extra precision damage to flat-footed creatures.; Turn to Mist - [1 Action] - (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.; Human vampire guard; Children of the Night - (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves, but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.; Mist Escape [Free Action] - - Trigger: The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. Effect: The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.",

The wall is 5 feet thick, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall; once created, it's permanent until Drazmorg uses this ability again, whereupon a previously created bone wall (such as the one at area G2) crumbles.

Effect: Hargulka snatches at a foe's shield, pulling it out of the way. He attempts an Athletics check against the Reflex DC of an opponent who has Raised a Shield before making a jaws Strike against the opponent. If the Athletics check succeeds, the shield is not considered raised against the jaws Strike. On a critical success, Hargulka pulls the shield out of position, so it is no longer raised until the opponent Raises the Shield again. This counts as two attacks toward Hargulka's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the jaws Strike.; Male troll warlord; Dream of Rulership - (abjuration, primal) The lingering effects of Nyrissa's inspiration are stronger than any fear Hargulka faces. Whenever he attempts a saving throw against a fear effect, he treats his actual result as one degree of success better than his rolled result.; Attack of Opportunity [Reaction] - -",

He loses his searing rune and blinding beam Strikes, but he gains a melee fist Strike that inflicts 4d8+19 bludgeoning damage.; Drain Luck - (curse, enchantment, mental, primal, misfortune) When the Lantern King damages a creature with his searing rune Strike, he drains the creature's luck. The creature must succeed at a DC 48 Will save or gain a -1 status penalty to all checks; it is then temporarily immune to Drain Luck for 1 round. Further damage dealt by the Lantern King's searing rune Strikes increases the status penalty by 1 on a failed save to a maximum status penalty of -4.

Whenever a creature misses the Lantern King with an attack or fails a skill check or saving throw, the creature is overtaken by overwhelming mirth at its mistake, as hideous laughter (DC 45 Will save).

The lich makes a hand Strike against the target; if he hits, he deals 6d6 negative energy damage. The target must attempt a DC 32 Will save, after which it is temporarily immune to Consume Memories for 24 hours. Critical Success The target takes no additional ill effects.

The creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals the victim is alive.; Male cyclops atrophied lich; Atrophied Lich - Sometimes, a lich that remains immobile and insensible for extended periods of time—as Vordakai did after he was imprisoned in his tomb just prior to Earthfall 10,000 years ago—can become atrophied. The exact effects of atrophy vary from lich to lich but always result in a reduction of spellcasting power and damage to their soul cage link.; In Vordakai's case, he has forgotten much arcane lore and lost a significant amount of his spellcasting ability. At the height of his power, he was a 20th-level wizard, but today, his power has reduced to that of a 12th-level wizard. More troubling to the lich is the fact that he can no longer use a soul cage to rejuvenate—if Vordakai is destroyed, he crumbles to dust, forever dead. Given time, Vordakai could recover his power and regain his rejuvenation ability, but it's unlikely the PCs will give him that chance, as it would take the lich several years to undo the ravages of centuries.; Counterspell [Reaction] - - Trigger: A creature casts a spell Vordakai has prepared. Effect: Vordakai expends a prepared spell to counter the triggering creature's casting of that same spell. He loses its spell slot as if he had cast the triggering spell. He then attempts to counteract the triggering spell.; Flash of Insight [Free Action] - - (divination, occult, fortune) Frequency once per day. Trigger: Vordakai is about to roll a d20.

A creature can prevent this regrowth by dealing acid or fire damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target acid or fire effects need to be targeted at a specific stump, but effects that deal splash damage or affect areas covering the hydra's whole space cauterize all stumps if they deal acid or fire damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any acid or fire damage, the stump is cauterized instantly.
